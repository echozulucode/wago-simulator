    title: "Drag-drop modules from explorer panel does not work"
    category: Bug
    severity: Medium
    priority: 2
    confidence: High
    scope: Local
    observed: |
      Dragging a module from the left Explorer panel and dropping it onto the
      rack area does not add the module. The drag operation appears to start
      (cursor changes), but dropping has no effect.
    expected: |
      Dragging a module type from the Explorer panel and dropping it onto the
      rack should add a new instance of that module to the rack at the
      appropriate slot position.
    trace_link: "apps/web/src/components/layout/LeftPanel.tsx"
    workaround: "Use the '+' button in the rack toolbar to add modules instead."
    status: Open
    next_action: "Investigate drag-drop event handlers in LeftPanel.tsx and WorkArea.tsx"

        note: "Issue created. Drag-drop was intended as primary module add method."

    title: "Module list lacks scrollbar when content overflows"
    category: Bug
    severity: Low
    priority: 3
    confidence: High
    scope: Local
    observed: |
      When the Explorer panel's module list contains more items than can fit
      in the visible area, there is no scrollbar visible. Users cannot access
      modules that are outside the visible viewport.
    expected: |
      When the module list exceeds the available vertical space, a scrollbar
      should appear (or the container should be scrollable) to allow access
      to all available module types.
    trace_link: "apps/web/src/components/layout/LeftPanel.tsx"
    workaround: "Resize the window to be taller, or collapse other sections."
    status: Open
    next_action: "Add overflow-y-auto to the module list container in LeftPanel.tsx"
    history:
      - timestamp: 2026-01-25T12:00:00Z
        note: "Issue created during UI testing."
